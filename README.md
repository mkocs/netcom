# About
Netcom attempts to be an easy-to-use in-network communication solution for UNIX (primary target Linux). The idea came up when I was testing Ethernet ports with a colleague and we had no way to easily communicate, sitting in different rooms. It's also a great way for me to expand my C knowledge.

# Usage
  - 'make' will compile client + server
  - 'make client' will compile only the client
  - 'make server' will compile only the server
  - './ncomclient' to run the client
  - './ncomserver' to run the server
  - 'make clean' cleans the directory (removed build/ and the binaries
